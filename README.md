dynamic-php-script-to-create-two-dimension-array
Making dynamic arrays can be hectic at times. 
I found a script I wrote some few years ago on how to create a dynamic HTML list based on MySQL stored data. 
There are 3 tables: cat ,which has the categories list, conditions, which has the list of conditions linked to the categories, and the details table which has an 
already stored condition id.

you can generate a html table having radio buttons where the user can select based on the different categories, 
and conditions to detail id already stored in the details table.   



Hope it helps someone out there.
